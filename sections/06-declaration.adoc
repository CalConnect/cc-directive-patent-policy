== Patent declaration requirements

Whatever the licensing requirements (<<licensing-requirements>>)
are, the patent holder must provide a written statement to be
filed at CalConnect, using the appropriate
"`Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration`" Form.

This statement must not include additional provisions, conditions, or
any other exclusion clauses in excess of what is provided for each case
in the corresponding boxes of the form.
